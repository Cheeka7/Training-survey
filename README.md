# Training-survey


Questionnaire\survey app. 
Employees in an organization when attending a seminar, use this app to answer questions based on the presentation.

There are two types of acesss roles in this app:
1. Admin- The admin can create pages dynamically and those new changes are published to the user that logs in. 
2. User- The user can access the app and take up the survey/questionaire based on the session attended.


The app could be integrated with Firebase and the code written is tailor made for that.
