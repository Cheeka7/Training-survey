# Training-survey


Questionnaire\survey app. 
Employees in an organization when attending a seminar, use this app to answer questions based on the presentation.

There are two types of acesss roles in this app:
1. Admin- The admin can create pages dynamically and those new changes are published to the user that logs in. 
2. User- The user can access the app and take up the survey/questionaire based on the session attended.


The app could be integrated with Firebase and the code written is tailor made for that.


Please note that the UI of the app is still under development. Cheers!
